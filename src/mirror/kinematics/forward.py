"""Forward kinematics for the SO-101 (ECE 4560, Assignment 6).

Where does the gripper end up, given the five arm angles?

The chain is a product of rigid-body transforms, one per joint:

    g_wt(theta) = g_w1(t1) g_12(t2) g_23(t3) g_34(t4) g_45(t5) g_5t

Each factor has the same shape: a FIXED offset (where the next motor is
bolted, with the frame twisted so its z-axis lies along that motor's shaft),
followed by Rz(theta) -- the joint's own spin about that z.

    g_i,i+1(theta) = [ R_fixed @ Rz(theta) | p_fixed ]

Every joint turns about its own frame's z. That is not a coincidence: the
fixed rotations are chosen to make it true, which is exactly what the URDF /
MuJoCo XML encodes as axis="0 0 1" on all six joints.

Joint 6 (the moving jaw) is ignored: opening and closing the jaw does not
move the grasped object's centre.

NUMBERS: taken from model/so101_new_calib.xml, not from the assignment
diagram. See the module self-test -- the diagram rounds three small offsets
away and that costs ~2 cm at the tool.
